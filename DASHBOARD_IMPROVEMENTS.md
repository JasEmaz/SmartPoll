# Dashboard Improvements

This document outlines the significant improvements made to the poll dashboard for better user experience, accessibility, and functionality.

## Overview

The dashboard has been completely transformed from a client-side rendered component to a server-side rendered page with enhanced poll categorization, improved accessibility, and better user experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering
- **Poll fetching happens on the server** before page render
- **Safer expiry checks** with consistent server-side timestamp handling
- **Better SEO and performance** with pre-rendered content

### 2. Poll Categorization
- **Ongoing Polls**: Active polls with green styling and full functionality
- **Expired Polls**: Past-due polls with red styling and limited functionality
- **Visual distinction** using color-coded backgrounds and badges

### 3. Accessibility Compliance
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** color contrasts:
  - Green theme for ongoing polls (4.5:1+ contrast ratio)
  - Red theme for expired polls (4.5:1+ contrast ratio)
- **Semantic HTML** with proper headings and sections
- **Tooltips** for disabled actions with clear explanations
- **Screen reader friendly** icons and labels

### 4. Enhanced Sharing
- **Smart share controls** that disable for expired polls
- **Tooltip feedback** explaining why sharing is disabled
- **QR code generation** for easy mobile sharing
- **Copy-to-clipboard** functionality with visual feedback

### 5. Responsive Design
- **Two-column grid** on medium screens and larger
- **Mobile-first approach** with stacked layout on small screens
- **Card-based design** for better visual organization
- **Proper spacing and typography** for readability

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- **Status badges** clearly indicating poll state (Active/Expired)
- **Expiry timestamps** showing when polls expire or expired
- **Vote counts** with visual icons
- **Action grouping** with logical button placement
- **Loading states** and error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Added expires_at field to polls table
ALTER TABLE polls 
ADD COLUMN expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

### New Components
- `DashboardSharePoll`: Handles sharing with state-aware functionality
- `DeletePollButton`: Server action-powered delete with confirmation
- `Tooltip`: Accessible tooltip component for UI feedback

### Server Actions Enhanced
- `getUserPolls()`: Now categorizes polls and handles expiry logic server-side
- Returns structured data with `ongoingPolls` and `expiredPolls` arrays

## Color Scheme & Accessibility

### Ongoing Polls (Green Theme)
- Background: `bg-green-50` (#f0fdf4)
- Border: `border-green-200` (#bbf7d0) 
- Text: `text-green-800` (#166534)
- Badges: `bg-green-100` with `text-green-700`

### Expired Polls (Red Theme)
- Background: `bg-red-50` (#fef2f2)
- Border: `border-red-200` (#fecaca)
- Text: `text-red-800` (#991b1b)
- Badges: `bg-red-100` with `text-red-700`

All color combinations meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 ratio).

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Server-side data fetching** - polls load before page render  
✅ **Poll categorization** - ongoing vs expired sorting  
✅ **Share functionality** - copy URL and QR code for active polls  
✅ **Disabled sharing** - tooltips show "Poll expired" message  
✅ **Responsive layout** - two columns on medium+ screens  
✅ **Color contrast** - meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards  
✅ **Accessibility** - keyboard navigation and screen readers  
✅ **Loading states** - proper error handling  

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+

## Migration Guide
